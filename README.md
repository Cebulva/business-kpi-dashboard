## 1. Introduction

This repository holds a portfolio project that demonstrates my ability to tackle a real-world business challenge under pressure. In this scenario, I'm the newly hired data professional at GoExplore, a rapidly growing company facing a data crisis. My task was to transform a single, raw spreadsheet into a dynamic KPI dashboard in just two weeks, providing the CEO with the tools to gain ongoing insights and better steer the company.

This project showcases my ability to move beyond just analyzing data to building a sustainable analytical framework. It highlights my skills in identifying key business metrics, using various tools from simple spreadsheets to structured data warehouses, and creating intuitive dashboards that empower non-technical leaders to make informed decisions.

### 3. Project Workflow

This project was built following a logical progression from raw data to a final dashboard. This section outlines each key phase.

### 3.1. Data Exploration And KPI Discovery
The initial phase involved exploring the raw spreadsheet to understand the data and identify potential KPIs. Google Sheets was used as the primary tool for this. This stage focused on using pivot tables to summarize data and find insights that would be valuable to the CEO.

### 3.2. Data Modeling in a Warehouse
To move from a simple spreadsheet to a robust, scalable solution, the data was modeled for a data warehouse. This involved structuring the data into a star schema using BigQuery, which separates the facts (sales data) from the dimensions (products, retailers, etc.). This design is optimized for analytical queries, aligning with an OLAP approach to data.

### 3.3. Final Dashboard And Visualization
The final step was to build an interactive dashboard in Looker Studio. This tool was connected directly to the BigQuery queries, allowing for dynamic visualizations that bring the KPIs to life. The dashboard provides a clear, high-level overview of the company's performance, allowing the CEO to intuitively grasp key metrics.
